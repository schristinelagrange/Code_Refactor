# Code_Refactor

## Description

- My  motivation for this project was simplify the css for the Horiseon website in order to achieve long-term sustainability for the web-developers working on it.


- I built this project in order to show how the code behind a website can produce a nice outcome for a user viewing the webpage, but still not be structured well (ie. unorgaized, repetitive) from the perspective of someone viewing the code behind it.


- The main problem I solved was the repetition behind the css. There were too many classes being used that all had the same styling, that coud easily be simplified by creating just a few classes to style more elements on the webpage. Another problem I came across was that one of the links was not functioning because it was missing an identifer in the html file. 


- I learned that there are many ways to code and still achieve the same output on a webpage. The average user viewing the website won't notice anything if you change the classes in your css for example, however, a web developer working on the website would have a much easier time viewing the code and make changes to it if it's well simplified and consolidated.
